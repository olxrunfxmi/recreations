# recreations

A worldly attempt at recreating some really cool websites I have seen.

This is a process of learning how to build really good interfaces and understand design and engineering choices as it concerns website landing pages.

## List

### → Studio:Null: A design agency

Worked on creating the same layout across Desktop, Tablet and Mobile View using flexbox. Wrote some JS for the random color boxes on click and simulation of single page view.

Need to add the fading effect, animations for the single page transition, and align some text properly to make it more fluid.

### → Matt Jumper: A Toronto Designer

Created the same viewport design and some of the hover interactions. My hover effect interaction is a bit buggy, so I need to learn how to deal with event bubbling - I believe. I tried to do the same layout without media queries but I just had to for padding changes.

Need to learn more about CSS Animations

## Changes

→ Design and Built a quick UI directory for all recreations
